# Question-Answer-Generation-Pipeline-with-LLM
This project focuses on generating question-answer pairs from text data using a language model (TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF). It involves merging data from multiple CSV files, preprocessing the text, and leveraging an LLM to automatically create relevant question-answer pairs.
# Key Contributions
## CSV Data Merging:
Wrote scripts to merge data from news articles and reviews stored in CSV files into a single dataset.
## Question-Answer Generation: 
Implemented a pipeline to generate question-answer pairs from the merged text data using the Mistral-7B large language model.
## Documentation: 
Documented installation, usage, and project structure for user clarity.
